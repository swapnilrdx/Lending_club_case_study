## General Information

This project aims to analyze loan data to identify factors that contribute to loan defaults. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.



## Conclusions

* **Loan Grade:**  Higher loan grades (e.g., F, G) have a significantly higher default rate.
* **Loan Term:**  Longer loan terms (60 months) exhibit a higher default rate compared to shorter terms (36 months).
* **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):**  Applicants with higher DTI values have a greater tendency to default.
* **Purpose of Loan:**  Loans for specific purposes (e.g., small business) show a higher default rate.
* **Public Records:**  Borrowers with a history of derogatory remarks or bankruptcies have an increased risk of default.


## Technologies Used
* **Python:**  Programming language for data analysis and model building.
* **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis library.
* **NumPy:** Numerical computing library.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization libraries.
* **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
